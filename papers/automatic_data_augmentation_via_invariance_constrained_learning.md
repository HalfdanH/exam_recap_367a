# Automatic Data Augmentation via Invariance Constrained Learning

## Problem they are trying to solve / Purpose of method

- Choosing appropriate transformations beforehand
- Source of bias
- Trial and error -> time consuming

__More details__

## How does it differ from other methods?

(Not clear, have to check the paper.)

- Compare what is different from other methods.
- What makes this method unique?

## How the method works

Mitigating bias using Invariance-Constrained Learning.

- Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling.
- Algorithm 1: Independent MH(what is this?) sampler.
- Algorithm 2: Primal-Dual Augmentation
