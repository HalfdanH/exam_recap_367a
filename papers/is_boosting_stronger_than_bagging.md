# Binary Classification: Is Boosting stronger than Bagging?

## Problem they are trying to solve / Purpose of method

Vanilla Random Forests(RF/Bagging) assumes that all samples
are equal, and all models(trees) are equally important.

- What are the previous problems that needs to be solved?
- Why is the method introduced/needed?

## How does it differ from other methods?

Applies sample weights and weights to each model (tree).

__MORE DETAILS__

- Compare what is different from other methods.
- What makes this method unique?

## How the method works

They apply weights and probabilites to samples.
Youden's J Statistic.

Model weighting uses a combination of 
nearest neighbors, best trees, and cleaning.

__CHECK PAPER__

- Explain the details of the method, simple overview first,
then more details.
